  *
 * A sensor interface, represents the interface of a sensor. A sensor is the main part of 
 * the network of sensor. It is composed of a Memory, a Queue , a Captor and an IOPorts.
 * 
 * It is a container for all these elements. The simulator triggers hooks methods of the sensor,
 * and each method is forwarded to the correspond sensor's element.
 * 
 * All hook methods are called in that order in each step of the simulation
 * - simulateCapture()
 * - activateCaptor()
 * - activatePort()
 * - activateQueue()
 *
 *  
 * - toString() method is called for statistical purpose
